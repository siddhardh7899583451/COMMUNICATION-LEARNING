3-Minute Pitch: Razor–Razorblade Model (Gillette, 1950)

Ladies and gentlemen,

In The changing times, our challenge is simple but critical: how do we make shaving affordable for every man, while building a profitable and sustainable business for Gillette?

The answer lies in what we call the Razor–Razorblade Model.

Instead of treating the razor as a one-time purchase, we have redesigned shaving into a long-term relationship with the customer. We sell the razor handle at a very low price, sometimes close to cost, so that every man can easily adopt our product. Once he owns a Gillette razor, he naturally returns to us to buy replacement blades, which are consumables and need to be purchased regularly.

This model solves three major problems.

First, mass adoption.
By lowering the upfront cost of the razor, we remove the biggest barrier to entry. Millions of men can afford a Gillette razor, making us the default choice for daily grooming and the leader of the industry

Second, recurring revenue.
While the handle is bought once, blades are bought repeatedly. This creates a steady, predictable stream of income that allows us to invest in better manufacturing, sharper blades, and stronger distribution.

Third, customer lock-in.
Our blades are specifically designed to fit Gillette razors. Once a customer chooses our system, switching becomes inconvenient. This strengthens brand loyalty and protects us from competitors.

Beyond pricing, we continuously improve blade quality—making them safer, sharper, and longer-lasting. These incremental innovations justify repeat purchases and reinforce trust in the Gillette name.

In short, the Razor–Razorblade Model transforms shaving from a product sale into a lifetime value business. It aligns customer convenience with company profitability.

By giving away the razor, we don’t lose money—we earn loyalty, repeat purchases, and market leadership.

That is how Gillette wins today—and for decades to come.

Thank you.
