The Decoy Effect – Strategy (Speech)
Level 1: Just Action

Imagine you’re choosing a subscription.
You see three options:

Web only for $59

Web + Print for $125

Print only for $125

Most people instantly choose Web + Print.
That decision didn’t happen by accident—it was designed.

Level 2: Fact + Action

Here’s the key fact:
The Print-only plan at $125 is the decoy.

It costs the same as Web + Print but offers less value.
When customers compare the two $125 options, Web + Print appears to be the obvious winner—so they upgrade.

Level 3: Emotion + Fact + Action

Now think emotionally.

You’re scrolling through the options and suddenly feel smart choosing Web + Print.
You tell yourself, “Why would I pay $125 for just printing when I can get everything for the same price?”

That feeling of getting a “better deal” pushes you to spend more than you originally planned, even though you came looking for the $59 option.

Level 4: Visual Story + Emotion + Fact + Action

Picture this.

You’re holding your phone late at night, comparing plans.
The $59 web-only option feels basic.
Then your eyes land on Print-only: $125—expensive and limited.

Right next to it is Web + Print: $125.

Suddenly, your brain lights up.
Same price. More value. Smarter choice.

You click Web + Print, feeling confident—almost proud.
What you didn’t notice is that the Print-only option was never meant to be chosen.
It existed only to guide you.

That’s the Decoy Effect in action.

: What Is the Decoy Effect?

The Decoy Effect—also called asymmetric dominance—occurs when a third, inferior option makes another option appear far more attractive.
Businesses use it to shift customer decisions toward a higher-value or higher-profit choice.
: How It Works (Using Economist Example)

Target option: Web + Print ($125)

Decoy option: Print only ($125, fewer benefits)

Anchor option: Web only ($59)

The decoy makes the target look like a no-brainer upgrade.

: Why It Works

Our brain avoids complex decisions.

We compare options, not absolute value.

The decoy justifies us in spending more.

: Using the Decoy Effect in Business

Decide which option you want customers to choose

Add a slightly worse option at a similar price.

Keep choices limited to three.

Let comparison do the persuasion.

The Decoy Effect doesn’t force decisions—it guides them.
Once you see it, that is, observe, you’ll notice it everywhere—from subscriptions to popcorn to smartphones.

The real power isn’t in the price.
It’s in how the options are guided.
